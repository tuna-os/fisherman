## [Unreleased]

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **OCI layout for non-composefs installs**: Non-composefs images (bluefin, lts,
  lts-hwe) now export to an OCI layout at scratch and use `--source-imgref oci:...`
  for `bootc install to-filesystem`. The previous VFS squash path corrupted ostree
  commit structure, producing “Expected commit object, not File”. The overlay
  redirect eliminates ENOSPC on 8+ GiB images by placing working container layers
  on the target disk instead of the 1.4 GiB live overlayfs.
- **`--source-imgref` in direct mode**: Direct mode now emits `--source-imgref`
  so `bootc install to-filesystem` does not fail with “must be executed inside
  a podman container” on offline live-ISO installs.

### 📊 Partition Layout

- **2 GiB /boot**: grub2 `/boot` ext4 partition increased from 1 GiB → 2 GiB.
  Each kernel+initramfs pair (200–400 MiB with NVIDIA drivers) fills 1 GiB quickly
  once deployment + rollback + staged upgrade accumulate.
- **2 GiB ESP for all fleet images**: grub2 EFI System Partition increased from
  512 MiB → 2 GiB for fleet consistency with systemd-boot (dakota) images.
